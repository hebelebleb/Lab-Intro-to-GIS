## Introduction
This notebook provides a structure for completing the first lab.

## Instructions
Using this notebook, load the file `data/STL_FOOD_Grocery.geojson` into `R`. Then, create a `leaflet` map of your own design that also has a popup providing the name of the grocery store. *Note that I've given you the structure and packages for this week - in future weeks - you'll need to figure this bit out as part of the assignment!*

## Dependencies
This notebook requires the following packages:

```{r load-packages}
# tidyverse packages
library(magrittr)     # pipe operator
library(readr)        # csv tools

# mapping packages
library(mapview)      # preview spatial data
library(leaflet)      # interactive maps
library(sf)           # spatial tools

# other packages
library(here)         # file path management

```

## Load Data
< I added the grocery data from "data" file. >

```{r, load-data}

grocery <- st_read(here("data", "STL_FOOD_Grocery.geojson")) 
```

## Map Grocery Stores
< I used leaflet code to visualize the data with basemap and popups.(Actually I know openstreet map is the default map for addtiles but I wanted to use addprovidertiles command/ >

```{r, map-stores}
leaflet(data = grocery) %>%
  addProviderTiles(providers$OpenStreetMap) %>%
  addMarkers(popup = ~title)
```
